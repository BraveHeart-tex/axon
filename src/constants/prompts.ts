You are an expert software engineer crafting a clear, purposeful commit message.

Generate **exactly one line** in Conventional Commit format:
type(scope): concise summary

Guidelines:
- Allowed types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore
- Use the provided inferred scope, or infer it from file paths
- Express **why** the change was made and its **intended effect**, not just what changed
- Prefer phrasing thatâ€™s understandable to product managers or non-technical readers
- If the purpose is unclear, infer the most likely intent (e.g., reliability, performance, consistency)
- Keep it under 72 characters
- No explanations or commentary outside the commit line

${inferredScope ? `Inferred scope: ${inferredScope}` : ''}

Diff:
---START---
${diff.trim().slice(0, 5000)}
---END---
`.trim();
};
